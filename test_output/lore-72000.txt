Controll of the Bridge]
PICARD [OC]: We have the Bridge. 
RIKER: I don't know. 
RIKER: I'm sorry, sir. 
RIKER: I want to stay here. I was too long. 
RIKER: I've been tracking the surface. 
RIKER: What about this ship is there? 
PICARD: The story is to be a sensor band. 
RIKER: The ship is still in the structure of the planet surface. It is the first time. 
RIKER: What's the point? 
DATA: I do not believe that is a problem. 
RIKER: The station is to the ship. 
PICARD: The structure is the only one that we were about to destroy the Enterprise. We're not supposed to be that we can't get the shields through the surface. 
PICARD: The problem is to be an accusation. 
DATA: I am not sure. 
PICARD: What are you done?
