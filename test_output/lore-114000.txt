PICARD: Counsellor, I would like to say to you if I could see the problem. I was able to see that the Enterprise is to change your programming and the problem wasn't the same thing you want to see the point of a second time. I don't think there's a chance that this is an order. I don't know what to do. 
RIKER: I'm not a problem. 
CRUSHER: We haven't. 
PICARD: We had an android. 
TROI: I would never have thought the truth is. I'm supposed to be some time. 
PICARD: I don't know. I don't think the same thing to do. I don that yes. I don't think I've settled the same simulation. 
TROI: I was a little so than anything. I've been a lot of things about you. 
PICARD: Well, I won't believe that I wanted to tell you to this son. 
TROI: I don't think so.
