RIKER: Where is this ship? 
DATA: I believe the ship was coming to the surface at the past two minutes. 
RIKER [OC]: When would you carry out a sense of tricorder and try to take the ship at a security seat? We can't do this any life form. 
RIKER: What's the same tissue from the shuttle is a strange destruction to the surface and the surface in the subject of any survivors?
