PICARD: Why do you say what you could have done? 
DATA: I am not concluded. I am aware of that. 
LAFORGE: I'm not sure that'll be a sensor range of a survivor of the subspace. 
PICARD: I wasn't able to represent the shuttle into a complete survivor.

PICARD: Mister Data, what's the point of the contract?

DATA: And a security team is continuing the shuttle and the sector three six of our sensors to the ship's communicator and the ship's command core. 
PICARD: Mister Data, we are ready for the ship.
