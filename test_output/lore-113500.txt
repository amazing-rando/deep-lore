DATA [OC]: It is a mistake. 
RIKER [OC]: I can't locate them. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: I'm sorry, Data. 
DATA: Thank you, Captain. 
PICARD: I'll go along the control room. 
LAFORGE: And what's going on? 
RIKER: We can't do this at the same thing to do. 
PICARD: What about the power surges? 
LAFORGE: I don't know what happened. 
PICARD: I won't believe this is an opportunity. I want you to get the shields on the Bridge. 
LAFORGE: I'll have to. 
PICARD: What is it? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. 
RIKER: Well the ship is alive. 
RIKER: When we get to the ship and the station of the presence of the plot that's all they're going to have to do it. 
ROBIN: I'm sorry. 
WORF: I am a man. 
LAFORGE: I want you to keep the power transfer to the surface and the storms are still alive. It seems to be a chance to transport them to the ship. 
RIKER: I'm afraid that's not the same thing you do think is to be. 
PICARD: I don't think so. 
DATA: I would be able to respond to the ship.
