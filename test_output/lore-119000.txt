The Ferengi ship 
Captain's log, Stardate 47688,3. The Enterprise is at the starbase on any survey of the planet. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
LAFORGE: They're attacked. 
PICARD: Stand by for a field of the plasma field. 
LAFORGE [OC]: I'm sorry. I've been trying to take the shields and run a security team to see if that would be an explosive. 
RIKER: The sensor range of the planet is a starship on the surface and transmitted a complete subspace field. 
RIKER: Transporter Room to Enterprise. 
RIKER: That's all right. The shield is standing by. 
RIKER: Take us to the surface. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Worf, are you all right? 
LAFORGE: No, sir, I've got a power to stand by for the secondary power transfer. 
PICARD: Maintain the field. 
(The ship is in an interface and takes a console) 
LAFORGE: So to stay on the Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Acknowledged. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, that would be a ship to take the shields to the Bridge. I'm sure that's what I want to discuss it.
